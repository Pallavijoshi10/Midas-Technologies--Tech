# Title : Ecommerce (Online Shopping)

# Introduction: 
##
 This is the era of technology and seeing the scenario of the world ,Kathmandu is one of
the most advanced city of Nepal where the technology meets the people.
Nowadays,people are so dependent on internet and mobile,smart devices ,they just do not
even need to go out for a shopping. So, looking at this and as per my analysis , I have
targeted this city and to build the ecommerce app which facilitates the people to shop
online with the help of mobile device.The main aim to build this app is to make human ,
shop with just a tap on their mobile screen and get the goods at their doorstep. Not only
that,Through this app ,business can be expanded globally.

# Background of the Project:

    Ecommerce app lets the user or customer to signup and login on their device. Once,it is
    logged in , they will be previewed with the items and even it will be made user friendly so
    that they dont have to learn for this app. It will be based on people oriented .They can
    search the products and just checkout which they need and get it on their doorstep .
    Nowadays, people rely on technology. Online shopping reduces the time and it just saves .
    Even they dont have to bargain. Price will be reasonable and they can filter and sort the
    price as they want. Last but not the least, app will be mobile responsive and the interface
    will be much more easier to use.

# Rest Client
##
# Why Retrofit?
Retrofit is a REST Client for Android and Java by Square. It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice. In Retrofit you configure which converter is used for the data serialization. Typically for JSON you use GSon, but you can add custom converters to process XML or other protocols. 
#Retrofit uses the OkHttp library for HTTP requests.
#Every method of an interface represents one possible API call. It must have a HTTP annotation (GET, POST, etc.) to specify the request type and the relative URL. The return value wraps the response in a Call object with the type of the expected result.
